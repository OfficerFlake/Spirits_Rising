Spirits Rising is a novel concept game for Unity C#.

Initial target platform is windows but the libraries used will be natives and universals so that system dependance is not required.

The project structure is such to allow some public visibility of assets and other WIP; yet hide the key driving features of the game for commerical protection.

README.md should exist at the top level of the git repo's only - for an further readme, see the project implementation itself by opening the .cs files or loading assets in Unity and vieweing their properties/notes/etc.
